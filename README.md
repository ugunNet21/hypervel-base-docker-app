# Hyper-App Documentation

This is a Hypervel-based application running on Docker with PHP and Swoole. The project uses Laravel-like artisan commands and is configured to run efficiently in a containerized environment. This README provides instructions for setting up, running, and managing the application.

## Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.
- PHP 8.3 or compatible version (handled by the Docker image).
- Composer for dependency management (installed in the container).
- A `.env` file configured with your environment variables (use `.env.example` as a template).
- Optional: MySQL or PostgreSQL if using a database (configured in `docker-compose.yml`).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> hyper-app
   cd hyper-app
   ```

2. **Copy Environment File**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` to configure your database, application settings, and other environment variables.

3. **Build and Start Docker Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This starts the Hypervel application on port `9501`. If using a database, uncomment the relevant database service in `docker-compose.yml` and update `.env` accordingly.

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app composer install
   ```

## Running the Application
- **Development Mode**:
  The `docker-compose.yml` is configured to run `php artisan watch` for hot-reloading:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
  Access the application at `http://localhost:9501`.

- **Production Mode**:
  Modify the `command` in `docker-compose.yml` to:
  ```yaml
  command: php artisan start
  ```
  Then restart the containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
  ```

## Database Migration
- **Run Migrations**:
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
  ```
  This applies pending migrations. Example output:
  ```
  Migrating: 2023_08_03_000000_create_users_table
  Migrated:  2023_08_03_000000_create_users_table
  ```

- **Fresh Migration** (drops all tables and re-runs migrations):
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh
  ```
  Example output:
  ```
  Dropped all tables successfully.
  [INFO] Migration table created successfully.
  Migrating: 2023_08_03_000000_create_users_table
  Migrated:  2023_08_03_000000_create_users_table
  ```

- **Database Configuration**:
  Ensure your `.env` file includes the correct database settings, e.g.:
  ```
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql
  DB_HOST=db
  DB_PORT=3306
  DB_DATABASE=hypervel
  DB_USERNAME=hypervel
  DB_PASSWORD=secret
  ```
  Update `docker-compose.yml` to include the database service if not already enabled.

## Environment Configuration
- The `.env` file is loaded automatically by Hypervel.
- Key variables to configure:
  - `APP_NAME`: Application name.
  - `APP_ENV`: Environment (`local`, `production`, etc.).
  - `APP_KEY`: Run `docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate` to set this.
  - Database credentials (see above).
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive values in `docker-compose.yml`. Use `.env` instead.

## Troubleshooting
- **Permission Issues**:
  If you encounter volume permission issues (common with SELinux), add `:Z` to the volume mount in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - .:/data/project:Z
  ```
  Alternatively, run the container as root (not recommended for production):
  ```yaml
  app:
    privileged: true
    user: root
  ```

- **Nothing to Migrate**:
  If `php artisan migrate` shows "Nothing to migrate," ensure migration files exist in `database/migrations/`.

- **Container Logs**:
  Check logs for errors:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs app
  ```

- **Database Connection Issues**:
  Verify the database service is running and the `.env` credentials match the `docker-compose.yml` configuration.
